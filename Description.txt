1) Creating a new sensor:
UltrasonicSensor mySensor (TrigPin, EchoPin);
mySensor - The name of the sensor
TrigPin - Trig The pin number to be inserted into the input
EchoPin - Echo the pin number to be connected to the port

2) Get ()
Reads the distance and returns the value as a decimal fraction.
float distance = mySensor.Get ();
distance - The name of the variable into which the distance measured from the sensor is stored

3) GetAvg () \ GetAvg (num)
Returns the average of a series of measurements.
num - The number of measurements to take
float PreciseDistance = mySensor.GetAvg (6);
The default is to perform five tests - if no other number is passed this is the number of tests that will be performed.

4) Blocked ()
Checks whether there is a bone at a minimum distance from the sensor - an object that blocks its path, and returns true or false as follows:
if (mySensor.Blocked ())
{
* do somthing *
}
The default distance is 10 inches. If there is a bone less than that distance, the method returns "True"
The default distance can be changed, as illustrated below.

5) StoppingDistance
The default distance, if there is a bone less than that distance, the sensor will count as a barrier.
The distance is measured in inches.
This distance can be changed as follows:
mySensor.StoppingDistance = value;
value - The new distance that is set as the default distance. Number between 3 and 100 cm.
